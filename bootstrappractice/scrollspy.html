	<h2>First Section</h2>
	<p>Asia's Largest Technical & Entrepreneurial Festival organized by the student community of IIT Kanpur.
	 The 24th edition will be held from 15th-18th March'18. Our efforts, work, and thoughts, all are synced to one simple thing only – help our society as much as we can. To ensure our goal, we have set up an international platform for the people to innovate and compete. Here, at Techkriti we truly believe that this can be done by having competitions and letting people crave for the best. In the process, everyone from the society will eventually lead to a better place.
	 </p>
	 <p> Keeping this in mind, we have introduced our theme “Prism of Possibilities”. Techkriti serves as a prism to the masses to refract innovation through their own perspectives and creation and proffers leadership in full colors. Every day in the festival introduces a new beginning, all psyched up to disperse into the horizon of infinite possibilities.
	Techkriti is the annual inter-collegiate Technical and Entrepreneurship festival organised by the students of IIT Kanpur. Techkriti was launched in 1995 with the aim of developing interest and encouraging innovation in technology among students of India. Techkriti hosts a plethora of Competitions, Exhibitions, Lectures and Shows.
	 In its twenty second edition, Techkriti has evolved and grown, fulfilling its purpose and becoming one of the most eagerly-awaited college technical festivals in Asia. Now, schools are also a part of this extravaganza with the introduction of a new event called "TOSC" (Techkriti Open School Championship).</p>
